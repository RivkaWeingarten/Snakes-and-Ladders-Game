# Snakes-and-Ladders-Game

I am creating this game for my milestone project.

I play this constantly with my nieces and nephews.

Today I created Divs for the board game in a container. i needed to reverse order every second row. and i added a different color tile to every odd tile.
Also positioned all the elements via CSS.
